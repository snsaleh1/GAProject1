## Play the game!
[Rep Your City](https://www.rep-your-city-ga19.surge.sh)

<h2>Objectives</h2>

* You have 60 seconds
* Match the student card with the corresponding cohort city.
* Due to cohort enrollment limitations:

    - Santa Monica requires 6 student matches to win
    - San Francisco requires 8 student matches to win
    - Dallas requires 8 student matches to win

### When the game loads:

- Player will click on the “Let’s do this” button to begin the game and initiate the 60 second timer.
    
- Player will click on "Gimme a Card!" to draw a random student from the "studentCards" array.
- After each play, the student will be pushed into a seperate "receptical" array to prevent repeat students
- The game ends when a city gets its minimum required number of student matches to trigger the winning game over protocol.
- If the player runs out of time then the game shuts down and a loss message appears.
